# microExpressionSurvey
1. The programming software used for the code is MATLAB, preferably the version of MATLAB R2018b or above.
2. Change all paths in the code to your file paths.
3. According to the Excel table given, all the pictures in the database are corresponding to the labels in the table. The pictures are required to be processed into the format of 28x28x3, and the grayscale images are processed into the format of 28x28.
4. The content of the first code is the identification of micro-expressions labeled positive, negative and surprised by the verification method LOSO.
The content of the second code is to verify the identification of micro-expressions labeled positive, negative and surprised by LOVO.
The content of the third code is the micro-expression recognition with nine categories of tags verified by LOSO.
Fourth code is the content of the verification method for LOSO with nine types of tags for micro-expression recognition.
5. The first two codes need to load net.mat, the last two code need to load net9.mat
